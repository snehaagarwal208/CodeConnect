# Memory Game - Java Code Matching

This is a memory game implemented using Java Swing, where the objective is to match the correct Java code to its corresponding output. The game tests your memory and knowledge of Java programming language. It provides an interactive and entertaining way to learn and reinforce your understanding of Java code snippets and their expected outputs.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game by running the Java program.
2. The game board will be displayed, consisting of a grid of cards. Each card represents a Java code snippet.
3. Click on any card to reveal its content. You will see a Java code snippet and a blank space for the expected output.
4. Click on another card to reveal its content.
5. If the code snippet and output match correctly, both cards will remain face up, and you will receive a point.
6. If the code snippet and output do not match, both cards will be turned face down again.
7. Continue revealing cards and trying to match them until all pairs are found.
8. The game ends when all pairs are matched.
9. Your final score will be displayed, indicating the number of correct matches you made.

## Game Features

- **Multiple Difficulty Levels:** The game offers different difficulty levels, ranging from easy to challenging. The difficulty level determines the number of code-output pairs to match and the complexity of the code snippets.
- **Score Tracking:** The game keeps track of your score by counting the number of correct matches made. Try to achieve the highest score possible!
- **Timer:** A timer is displayed to track the time you take to complete the game. Challenge yourself to complete it in the shortest time!
- **High Scores:** The game keeps a record of the highest scores achieved by players. You can aim to beat the existing high scores and establish your name on the leaderboard.
